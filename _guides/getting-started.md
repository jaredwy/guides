# Getting Started

This guide will help you get set up to build a project with Neon. If you already have everything installed and are looking to write your first Neon code, try the [Hello, World!](../hello-world/) guide.

## Install Node

Neon requires Node.js and supports **all versions since the most recent LTS release**. If you don't already have Node.js installed, or don't have a supported version, go to the [Node.js web site](https://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions.

## Install Rust

Neon requires Rust for development and supports **all versions of Rust since 1.15**. If you don't already have Rust installed, or don't have a supported version, go to the [Rust web site](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) for installation instructions.

## Install Node Build Tools

Neon depends on Node's plugin build tools, which have a few additional system requirements. These dependencies have different installation steps on different operating systems.

### Windows

The easiest and recommended way to set up a Windows development environment is with the `windows-build-tools` package. In a PowerShell or command prompt run as Administrator, run the following step:

```shell
C:\> npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

This installs all the system dependencies unobtrusively, without conflicting with any software already installed on your system.

#### Advanced: Manual setup

Alternatively, you can set up the Windows development environment manually instead of using `windows-build-tools`. **You do not need to do this if you used the recommended setup process above.**

  * On Windows Vista or Windows 7, install the [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773).
  * Install the Visual C++ Build Environment with one of the following options:
    1. Install the [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) using the _Default Install_ option.
    1. Install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select _Common Tools for Visual C++_ during setup.
  * Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 3 is **not** supported).
  * Run the following commands:

```shell
C:\> npm config set python python2.7
C:\> npm config set msvs_version 2015
```
</div>
</div>

<script>
$(function() {
  if (navigator.platform.startsWith("Win")) {
    $('#windows-installation-instructions').toggleClass('toggle-disabled');
  }
})
</script>

<div id="macos-installation-instructions" class="toggle toggle-disabled">
### macOS

The development dependencies for macOS are:

  * Python 2.7 (Python 3 is **not** supported)
  * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
  * Install the _Command Line Tools_ via Xcode under the menu _Xcode &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Downloads_.
</div>

<script>
$(function() {
  if (navigator.platform.startsWith("Mac"))
    $('#macos-installation-instructions').toggleClass('toggle-disabled');
})
</script>

<div id="generic-installation-instructions" class="toggle toggle-disabled">
### Generic

The generic Unix development dependencies are:

  * Python 2.7 (Python 3 is **not** supported)
  * `make`
  * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Most modern Unix systems, like Linux or FreeBSD, should have the required development dependencies installed already.
</div>

<script>
$(function() {
  if (!navigator.platform.startsWith("Win") && !navigator.platform.startsWith("Mac"))
    $('#generic-installation-instructions').toggleClass('toggle-disabled');
})
</script>

## Install the Neon CLI

Finally, use `npm` to install the Neon command-line toolchain.

```shell
$ npm install --global neon-cli
```

You can verify your Neon installation by running

```shell
$ neon version
```

from a shell, which should print out the version of Neon you just installed.
